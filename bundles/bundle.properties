status.extremus-null-lesion-database-entry-1a.description= Lesion.study; #0000001.....Date;.2155/XX/XX.....Lead.investigator;.LESION.DEPARTMENT.RESEARCHER.-.WAFT.XXXXXXX.....The lesion appear to be a strange biological mass that can grow and shape themselves into differing forms for a variety of different functions, the lesion have been observed making basic mobile forms for attacking local wildlife and our technology, lesion forms can appear to grow eyes and it has not yet been studied whether they can grow mouths or other features like hair teeth or bones, the eyes on lesion forms will need to be furthered studied to gather conclusive evidence on whether they work or are a decoy...
